# GWU_NN CNN Implementation by Don Kim

### Project Topic

The topic for my final project will be on “Convolutional Neural Networks”, which
was preapproved as an example project.

### Team

Working on the project individually.

### Research

This article written by Google provides great diagrams explaining the CNN model
as well as practice exercises to get introductory experience with the model.

Provides a great detailed introduction to the CNN model and the applications of
it. The research paper was written for its application to radiology, but the paper
provides detailed information about CNN’s in the beginning portion.

This textbook I found online provides a general overview of neural networks as
well as an explanation of the CNN model. It serves as a great general knowledge
resource
